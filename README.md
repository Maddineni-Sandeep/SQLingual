SQLingual: A Database Query Resolver is a comprehensive web application developed to bridge the gap
 between natural lan guage queries and structured SQL commands, making databases more
 accessible to users without extensive SQL expertise. The goal is to simplify the querying
 process by allowing users to interact with databases using everyday language, effectively
 low ering the barrier to data access for non-technical users. This full stack project provides
 a robust platform where complex database queries can be generated accurately, even in intri
cate database environments, addressing critical challenges such as schema complexity, query
 ambiguity, and SQL generation accuracy.
